navigation of your choice for three different views: adding exercise, viewing list of
exercises and settings for selecting units. The following examples are just to give the
basic structure of the layouts. Don’t mimic the style but make your own design. You
may use basic RN components or some external libraries like RN Paper but come up
with your own color theme e.g. by using color wheel.

    In the first view user may add workouts. Workout contains sport type (at least three
different options), distance, duration, and date. The button adds the workout and saves
it into context containing array of workouts. Check that only numeric values are allowed
for the distance and duration. Show alert if there’s negative distance/duration. Choose
the date from calendar dialog.

    Another navigation view displays a list of all added workouts. The list should be
scrollable. On top of the list the sum distances of different workout types are displayed.
Add some example workouts into to the workout array, so that there’s already
some workouts when starting the app.

    The settings view is quite simple but affects some calculations and conditional
rendering. Use radio buttons to select the units. If user changes to miles, workout
distance is given as miles => the input miles are converted and saved as kilometers in
objects. For the workout list all the distances are converted and displayed also in
corresponding units (round to two decimals in UI).
